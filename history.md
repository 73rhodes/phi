Retrieved from http://www.scribd.com/doc/14747396/Tschichold, 8 June 2014. Collection of Essays originally titled "De properties van het boek (Die Proportionen des Buches)" published posthumously in 1991. Tschichold describes a "Villard Diagram" though it isn't clear what the basis for this attribution is.

The work of Vitruvius had been rediscovered and was being referenced in the 15th century by architects like Giacomo Andrea Ferrara, a close friend of da Vinci. 

Francesco di Giorgio, _Trattato di Architettura Civile e Militare_ (1470).  Painter, visionary architectural theorist. His illustration is probably the original "Vitruvian Man".

Villard de Honnecourt, untitled [33 Sheets of parchment containing 250 drawings] (c. 1220-1240) retrieved from https://archive.org/details/albumdevillardde00vill 8 June, 2014. It is not clear how the so-called "Villard Diagram" has become attributed to Honnecourt.

Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, <i>De Architura</i> (c. 15 BC) See the "Rediscovery of Vitruvius" at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius#Rediscovery 
Rediscovered 1414 by Poggio Bracciolini and made widely known by artist Leon Battista Alberti in his book De re aedificatoria c. 1450.

Euclid, <i>Elements</i> (c. 300 BC). First recorded definition of the Golden Ratio ("extreme and mean ratio" ἄκρος καὶ μέσος λόγος)

Plato, <i>Timeaus</i> (c.360 BC).

"For whenever in any three numbers, whether cube or square, there is a mean, which is to the last term what the first term is to it; and again, when the mean is to the first term as the last term is to the mean—then the mean becoming first and last, and the first and last both becoming means, they will all of them of necessity come to be the same, and having become the same with one another will be all one"

This article tries to draw some connections between Euclid's geometry and the sketches of Villard de Honnecourt, proposing that the technique of dividing a space into 1/2, 1/3, etc can be seen in his work. It doesn't go so far as attribution. The so-called "Villard Diagram" seems to be an invention of Daniele Capo, who constructed it and made the attribution to Villard, however Tenuous. It does seem likely, however, that Villard and other architects and artists probably from Phidias (490-430 BC - who built the Parthenon statues)... from the ancient Greeks anyway... and certainly from Euclid (325-265 BC) onwards, knew methods of geometric construction that are illustrated by the so-called Villard Diagram. And not only the technique of dividing spaces into Nths, but of creating equilateral triangles and a great many other ingenious techniques for architecture and building. What the article by Marie-Therese Zenner is particularly interesting for is it's assertion that from the time of the ancient Greeks through the renaissance, from Euclid to Vitruvius to (Villard) de Honnecourt to da Vinci, artist and architect were two aspects of the same profession, and a knowledge of geometry was absolutely a requirement whether it was artistic rendering or engineering. You can see Honnecourts complete folio at https://archive.org/details/albumdevillardde00vill - it does not contain the so-called Villard Diagram. It certainly doesn't use any of these canons of page construction to define the layout of his sketchbook - as one tumblr post claimed - the margins are completely inconsistent, accidental, and frequently non-existent!

unknown, <i>Feuille de Papier</i>, website: http://www.ac-grenoble.fr/argouges/v1/PEDAGOGI/MAREAU/feuille_de_papier.htm retrieved 8 June, 2014.
Another source of attribution for the so-called Villard Diagram. It mentions Honnecourt but contains no supporting evidence that the technique of dividing a space into N parts came from him. It seems likely that this technique was known at least since Euclid and used by many artist-architects from ancient Greece onwards.
